    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** the client with your API key.  \n",
    "2. **Minimal call** to the API (Responses API).  \n",
    "3. Use **Chat Completions** for system + user roles.  \n",
    "4. Explore **temperature** (randomness) and **top_p** (nucleus sampling).  \n",
    "5. Add **system prompts** to guide behavior.  \n",
    "6. Try **streaming tokens** (like ChatGPT typing).  \n",
    "7. Get **JSON/structured outputs** with schemas.  \n",
    "8. Handle **errors, timeouts, and retries** gracefully.\n",
    "\n",

      "Once upon a time in a cozy little village, there lived a cat named Whiskers and a dog named Max. Whiskers was a sleek, gray tabby with striking green eyes, while Max was a jovial golden retriever with a heart as big as his bark. They lived on neighboring farms, and while their owners were friends, Whiskers and Max had never quite seen eye to eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers prided herself on her independence and grace. She spent her days prowling the rooftops, napping in sunbeams, and meticulously grooming her fur. Max, on the other hand, was all about fun and adventure. He loved to chase after sticks, dig in the dirt, and wag his tail at every passerby.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bright summer morning, a ruckus erupted in the village square. A mischievous little squirrel was darting about, stealing shiny trinkets from the market stalls. The villagers were in a frenzy, trying to catch the speedy thief. Whiskers watched from her perch on a fence, her curiosity piqued. Max, with his boundless energy, leapt into action, barking excitedly as he chased the squirrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the squirrel zipped past Whiskers, she caught his eye and, without thinking, leaped down from the fence. “You’ll never catch him that way!” she called to Max, who paused, panting and bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, really? And how would you do it?” Max replied, his tail drooping slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Follow my lead,” Whiskers said, flicking her tail with confidence. “I’ll distract him from above, and you can catch him from below.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Max blinked, surprised by her suggestion. He had always thought cats were aloof and uninterested in teamwork. But there was something about Whiskers’ determination that sparked a glimmer of hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, they devised a plan. Whiskers climbed to the top of a nearby apple tree, her eyes fixed on the squirrel, while Max circled the base, keeping his eyes peeled for any signs of movement. With a swift leap, Whiskers gracefully hopped from branch to branch, creating a rustling sound that caught the squirrel’s attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over here!” Whiskers called out, her voice playful yet commanding. The squirrel, intrigued by the noise, scampered toward the tree, thinking it was another shiny object to snatch.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that moment, Max sprang into action. With a bound, he leaped toward the base of the tree, barking loudly. The squirrel, startled, darted back up the trunk, but Whiskers was ready. She jumped down from her perch, landing softly beside Max.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now!” she shouted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Max lunged forward, and together, they managed to corner the squirrel. Realizing it was outnumbered, the squirrel surrendered, dropping the shiny button it had stolen and making a hasty retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The villagers erupted in cheers, clapping for the unlikely duo. Max, panting with excitement, turned to Whiskers, his eyes shining. “We did it! I never would have thought to work together like that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whiskers, her fur slightly ruffled but her spirit soaring, smiled back. “Sometimes, it takes a little teamwork to achieve great things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, Whiskers and Max became the best of friends. They spent their afternoons exploring the village, with Max teaching Whiskers how to enjoy the occasional romp in the grass, and Whiskers showing Max the art of climbing trees to watch the sunset from above. They proved that even the most different of friends can create a bond as strong as any.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, in their little village, the cat and dog became legends, a reminder that friendship knows no bounds, and that sometimes, it’s the most unexpected partnerships that lead to the greatest adventures.\n"
